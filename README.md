# Products Orders System

This WEB API represents an orders products system that can implement CRUD operation secure by token
and login procedure built with MVC for user display.

*Note:

- To run the app first, run GalconOrderssSystem and then run Login (It's optional) to upload the UI for the login form and products page.
- Using the login page UI use admin or Yuval for user and 1234 for password.
- Checking the functionality can run only GalconOrdersSystem and work using Swagger.

The Solution is divided into two major projects:
1. WEB API with token security
2. Login interface and products page
